# Create: Fantasizing Again
![Icon](/src/main/resources/icon.png)

A mod that adds some powerful things for Create! Includes:
- Two stress engines that are in perpetual motion!
- **Sturdy Girder**: A decorative block that resembles Metal Girder made from Railway Casing.
- **Tree Cutter**: An axe that can chop down an entire tree! (Formerly a Deforester, but it makes blocks fall vertically!)
- **Block Placer**: A tool that can place blocks at extremely long distances and destroy blocks instantly! (Formerly a Handheld Blockzapper, but it has almost all its powers unlocked without upgrading! Special thanks to @LopyLuna, most codes of this tool are copied from: https://github.com/LopyLuna/Block-n-Zapping)
- Chocolate can now be drawn infinitely!
