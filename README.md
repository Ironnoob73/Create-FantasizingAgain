![title](/src/unused/title.png)

A mod that adds some powerful things for Create! Includes:
- Two stress engines that are in perpetual motion!

- **Tree Cutter**: An axe that can chop down an entire tree! (Formerly a Deforester, but it makes blocks fall vertically!)

- **Block Placer**: A tool that can place blocks at extremely long distances and destroy blocks instantly! (Formerly a Handheld Blockzapper, but it has almost all its powers unlocked without upgrading! Special thanks to @LopyLuna, most of the codes of this tool are copied from: https://github.com/LopyLuna/Block-n-Zapping)

- **Transporter**: Easily transfer items from one container to another (Formerly a Transposer)!

- **Crate**: A container that can be combined along three axes and has adjustable capacity! Also features several other practical functions... (Formerly an Adjustable Crate)

- **Chromatic Compound**! Maybe useless, or maybe too powerful?

**Other changes**:
- Chocolate can now be drawn infinitely!
- Powder Snow can be stored in tanks like fluid.
